## Software Proposal: Block Diagram, Process Diagram, and Message Structure

This page presents the system-level overview and control logic of our teamâ€™s software proposal for the **automated curtain control system**.  
The diagrams included here illustrate the interaction between key subsystems â€” the **Hub Controller**, **Sensor Subsystem**, **Motor Control Subsystem**, and **User Input Logic** â€” and show how data and control messages flow between them during system operation.

The **block diagram** provides a high-level structural view of how the hardware and software components are interconnected.  
The **process (flow) diagram** outlines the softwareâ€™s logical flow from initialization through the main control loop, including sensor sampling, user input handling, state updates, and motor output control.
