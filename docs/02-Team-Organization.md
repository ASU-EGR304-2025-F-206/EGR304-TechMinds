## Team Charter

As a team, we collaboratively developed our charter at the beginning of the semester to establish a shared foundation of values, goals, and responsibilities. We reviewed several examples, including ASU’s institutional charter, to guide our discussion and ensure alignment with the spirit of inclusion, innovation, and accountability.

> **Team 206 Charter:**  
> *"Team 206 is committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment where every member contributes actively toward the development of meaningful, real-world engineering solutions. Our work is guided by open communication, shared responsibility, and a collective drive to grow both individually and as a team."*

This charter represents more than just a mission statement—it reflects how we intend to work together, make decisions, and hold each other accountable throughout the course. It was agreed upon through group discussion, with input from all members, and was documented formally during our initial planning phase.

For reference, our team organization process is further detailed in ["Appendix: Team Organization"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/Appendix/App-Team-Org/).

## Product Mission Statement

In defining our product's purpose, our team focused on identifying the core user problem we are aiming to solve and the value our solution will provide. We evaluated user needs, market gaps, and the broader impact our product could have in real-world applications.

> **Product Mission Statement:**  
> *"Our mission is to design a user-centered, reliable, and accessible embedded system that addresses a specific challenge with practical and innovative engineering solutions."*

This statement was the result of multiple brainstorming sessions during our concept development phase. We used tools like problem framing, stakeholder analysis, and voice-of-the-customer exercises to refine what our product stands for. The final mission statement serves as a guiding principle for all design and implementation decisions.
