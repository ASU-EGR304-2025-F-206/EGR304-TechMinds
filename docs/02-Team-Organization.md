## Team Charter

Team 206 is committed to fostering a collaborative, inclusive environment where every member actively contributes toward creating meaningful, real-world embedded systems. We prioritize user-centered design, safety, and reliable engineering practices as we design a modular motion-and-light-sensing curtain control subsystem. Our work is guided by open communication, shared responsibility, timely feedback, and a focus on measurable outcomes.

This charter represents more than just a mission statement—it reflects how we intend to work together, make decisions, and hold each other accountable throughout the course. It was agreed upon through group discussion, with input from all members, and was documented formally during our initial planning phase.

For reference, our team organization process is further detailed in ["Appendix: Team Organization"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/Appendix/App-Team-Org/).

## Product Mission Statement

Next, we wanted to make sure our product has a clear, meaningful purpose—something more than just a course requirement.


> **Product Mission Statement:**  
<<<<<<< HEAD
> *“Create a modular, low-cost curtain control subsystem that uses motion and ambient light sensing to automatically open and close curtains. The system should improve comfort, privacy, and energy efficiency in everyday homes and apartments, be easy to install, and interface with the class 8-wire ribbon connector and PIC18F57Q43 microcontroller. ”*

This statement isn’t just words on a page. We refined it through back-and-forth edits, aligning it with what we’re excited to deliver. It reminds us to stay focused on the “why” behind our work.
