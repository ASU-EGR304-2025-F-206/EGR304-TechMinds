## Team Charter

Team 206 is committed to fostering a collaborative, inclusive environment where every member actively contributes toward creating meaningful, real-world embedded systems. We prioritize user-centered design, safety, and reliable engineering practices as we design a modular motion-and-light-sensing curtain control subsystem. Our work is guided by open communication, shared responsibility, timely feedback, and a focus on measurable outcomes.

This charter represents more than just a mission statement—it reflects how we intend to work together, make decisions, and hold each other accountable throughout the course. It was agreed upon through group discussion, with input from all members, and was documented formally during our initial planning phase.

For reference, our team organization process is further detailed in ["Appendix: Team Organization"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/Appendix/App-Team-Org/).

## Product Mission Statement

Before defining our design, we established a guiding statement to ensure our product has a clear, meaningful purpose aligned with our team’s goals.

---

> **Product Mission Statement:**  
> *“Improve comfort, privacy, and energy efficiency in everyday homes and apartments by enabling curtains to respond automatically to motion and changing light conditions, using a system that’s easy to install and compatible with the project’s required interface standards.”*

This statement defines our **“why”** — the purpose driving our design.  
It ensures that our technical decisions stay focused on improving everyday living through practical, user-centered automation.
