## Team Goals

1. **Develop a Functional Prototype**: Design and integrate four distinct subsystem PCBs into one cohesive smart household device.
2. **Ensure Safety and Compliance**: Follow pinout standards and verify hardware/software before integration.
3. **Deliver User-Centered Value**: Create a solution that saves time, energy, or resources for household use.
4. **Strengthen Engineering Skills**: Build expertise in PCB design, embedded systems programming, and hardware/software integration.
5. **Maintain Professional Workflow**: Use Github, documentation, and structured project management to stimulate an industry process.

## Product Mission Statement  
 *“To create a user-friendly embedded system that enhances daily interactions by integrating seamless, reliable, and scalable technology—designed for real people and real-world use.”*

## Roles & Responsibilities

_**Appendix Table 2**: Project Roles and Duties_

| **Role**          | **Duties**                                                                                                                                | **Member**           |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- | 
| Meeting leader    | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting                                        | Mihir Patel  |
| Meeting recorder  | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned                          | Drew Sattre  |
| Assignment leader | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date                                                           | Adrian Perez  |

## Process for Roles

1. Roles rotates every **2 weeks** to give each member experience. 
2. Assignments made during weekly meetings by consensus.
3. Team members support one another to ensure role responsibilities are met.
4. Technical responsibilities (e.g., sensors, actuators, PCB design tasks) assigned based on strengths and interests, but cross-training encouraged.

## Team Coordination & Accountability

1. Assignments must be finished **48 hours** before deadlines for review.
2. Each member must "sign off" on work before submission. 
3. Feedback from design reviews shared with entire team and acted upon in next cycle
4. Missed Work Policy: 
**First occurrence** - private reminder,
**Second occurrence** - team discussion + redistribution of tasks,
**Ongoing issues** - escalate to instructor

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

1. Disagreements acknoledged openly in meetings.
2. Conflicts resolved by structured discussion: majority vote if no consensus.
3. Avoid overloading members with multiple roles to prevent conflicts of interest.
4. Escalation to instructor only if conflict cannot be resolved internally.
