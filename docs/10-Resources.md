## Team Circuit Overview

- The image below shows Team 206’s integrated circuit prototype, illustrating how the motor, temperature sensor, and photoresistor work together within the smart curtain control subsystem.

- The motor stage provides mechanical actuation for the curtain, while the temperature sensor tracks operating conditions to help prevent overheating and ensure long-term reliability.

- The photoresistor-based light sensor monitors ambient brightness, enabling the system to automatically adjust the curtain position to support user comfort and energy efficiency.
