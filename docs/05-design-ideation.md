## Intro / Overview

The design ideation for our automatic curtain controller narrows in on a safe and energy-efficient solution that adapts to household conditions. The product concept will integrate a light-sensing system with an automatic mortar curtain mechanism to adjust the natural lighting and reduce unnecessary energy consumption. In developing ideas, attention is driven to safety, durability, user experience, and functionality. The ideation process highlights balancing all of these categories with the features that the user needs. This gives the groundwork for revamping user needs into solutions that are well executed and user-friendly.

## Work Documentation

The brainstorming process of this section was carefully organised to transform user feedback & design requirements into features for our product. We worked closely as a team all and everyone contributed their ideas and insights equally throughout the idea development process. We initially proposed an in-person workshop to provide a more energetic exchange of ideas. But considering our respective schedules and commitments, we settled on a Zoom meeting. 

We also started a collaborative Google Document for us to meet and synthesize our ideas. This shared whiteboard allowed each team member to brainstorm on their own proposal in real time, mapped directly to identified user needs. Google Docs format was especially useful here for quick categorization/movement of ideas. This tool made all contributions equal, so no voice would dominate the conversation. Crucially, the Google Doc was an archive of our thoughts; all the little pieces that we might forget or lose were saved in one place.

Rapid ideation was also used in the session. It pushed us to express ourselves quickly, which helped create an environment where we could explore our own unique ways of thinking. The pace of ideating was important to keep up the momentum so that we could get as much in our basket as possible.

The list of requirements we compiled was rooted in previous project assignments, during which we thoroughly defined user needs and product specifications. These foundations stemmed from direct input by stakeholders, detailed user case analysis, and extensive market research. This research involved reviewing competitor products and closely analyzing customer feedback to clearly delineate user expectations and preferences. The insights gained from these assignments served as the backbone of our brainstorming process, allowing us to stay concentrated on developing a product that genuinely addresses user needs, rather than veering off into features that lack substantial value.

Once we had generated a diverse array of ideas and feature suggestions, we proceeded to categorize the requirements into specific groups, such as safety, functionality, and user-centric features. This categorization helped us visualize where our concepts were heavily focused and highlighted areas that required further exploration or refinement.

In order to establish the priority level for each proposed feature, we engaged in a collaborative discussion to determine which features would be classified as high, medium, or low priority. Each team member's insights were valued during this decision-making process, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the potential impact of each feature. Ultimately, we distilled the results of our discussions, and the features deemed to have the highest priority were identified to be carried forward into the next phases of our project. This structured approach not only guided our development efforts but also aligned our team’s focus on the most critical elements that would enhance the user experience.
