## Project Objective

The project focuses on investigating and developing adaptive technology to improve user experience and product design for an automatic curtain opener that uses sensors to improve energy efficiency at home. The goal is to reduce manual operation in the house by using motion and light sensors to adjust the position of the curtains based on environmental conditions and user activity. Integrating reliable, low-cost components in this product not only serves as a way to reduce energy consumption but also provides a more accessible solution to individuals with limited mobility. We aim to produce a user-friendly, adaptive, and durable device that demonstrates sensor automation for regular household tasks, setting a foundation for smart home innovations.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary users** – Homeowners, renters, and people with mobility challenges.  
  They seek convenience, reliable daily operation, easy control (app, voice, remote), and safety features that support accessibility and comfort.  

- **Secondary users** – Family members, roommates, or caretakers sharing the living space.  
  They need straightforward control options and assurance of the product’s safe operation for everyone’s peace of mind.  

- **Component suppliers & manufacturers** –  
  Vendors providing key parts like motors, sensors, and electronics. To ensure product reliability, they require precise technical specifications, quality standards, and consistent manufacturing processes.  

- **Maintenance & support teams** –  
  Responsible for troubleshooting, software updates, warranty support, and repair. They need durable, diagnostic-friendly hardware and accessible customer service systems.  

- **Retailers & distributors** –  
  These groups focus on strong, protective packaging, smooth logistics, easy returns, and products that earn positive customer feedback to boost sales and brand reputation.  

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Lauren**  
Lauren, 40, is a nurse with two young children in a chaotic apartment. Lauren loves waking up naturally, all thanks to the innovative curtain motor, which slowly opens her living room curtains as the sun rises, letting soft light fill the space and waking up her whole family in the most relaxing way. All she wants is a few sweet breaths of air on those quiet days when she can't open the windows without rousing every family member, pulling apart your child's curtains as slowly and quietly as possible, so her little ones won't wake up.  
And in the afternoon, working from home, Lauren closes the blinds through her app to block out blinding sun and glare during a video call. It responds in seconds, then sends her a notification when the task is complete. Lauren can also command Alexa with her voice while she’s got both hands full from other tasks, and stays where she is, whether sitting or standing, to switch the curtains.  

**User Story #2: Michael**  
Michael, a 25-year-old graduate student, is renting his first apartment. He’s a brilliant home enthusiast always looking for interesting ways to make his place smarter. Michael said the only thing he was surprised about was how easy it was to install his innovative curtain motor; with basic tools, it took him less than ten minutes to set up on his existing curtain rod. The app’s video guide made everything easy to understand and follow.  
Michael later personalized the schedules so that his blackout curtains slide closed every night automatically, then open gradually on weekends to allow him to sleep in. When he goes on holiday, he flicks the “holiday mode” switch to randomly turn up and down the curtains, giving his house a live-in feel. He loves demo-ing the remote app, and voice controls for friends, and I love that it has safety features such as child-proof hardware and automatic snag detection to prevent accidents from happening.

## Open Questions

- Should the device function as a standalone product or connect with existing smart-home systems like Alexa or Google Home?  
- How will the design avoid entanglement with the curtain?  
- How does the environmental impact of the manufacturing process compare to the resources potentially saved?  
- Can we make the product fully recyclable and repairable through design changes such as ZIF connectors or glue-free assembly?  
- How can we improve battery safety to avoid failures like overheating or self-ignition?
