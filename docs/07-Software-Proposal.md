## Software Proposal: Block Diagram, Process Diagram, and Message Structure

This page shows the system overview and control logic for our team’s **automated curtain control system**. The diagrams explain how the main parts — the **Hub Controller**, **Sensor Subsystem**, **Motor Control Subsystem**, and **User Input Logic** — work together and exchange data during operation.

The **block diagram** gives a general view of how the components are connected. The **process (flow) diagram** shows the step-by-step logic of the software, including setup, reading sensor data, checking user input, updating states, and controlling the motor.
