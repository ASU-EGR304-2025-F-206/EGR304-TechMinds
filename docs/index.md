## Welcome 
> Welcome to the official **TechMinds Project Report Website** for EGR 304. This site provides an overview of our team’s organization, design process, and progress throughout the semester.

## Team Introduction
**Team 206 (TechMinds)** is committed to fostering a collaborative, inclusive environment where every member actively contributes toward creating meaningful, real-world embedded systems.  
We prioritize user-centered design, safety, and reliable engineering practices as we design a **modular motion-and-light-sensing curtain control subsystem**.  
Our work is guided by open communication, shared responsibility, timely feedback, and a focus on measurable outcomes.  

## Project Summary

Our project focuses on developing a **smart curtain control subsystem** that responds to both motion and ambient light levels to enhance energy efficiency, comfort, and accessibility.  
The system integrates multiple sensors, a microcontroller-based control unit, and modular components for easy customization and scalability.  
Through iterative prototyping, benchmarking, and empirical testing, our team aims to create a reliable, user-friendly embedded system that aligns with modern home automation trends.
