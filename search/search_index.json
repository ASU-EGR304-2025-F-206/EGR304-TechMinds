Lauren loves waking up naturally, all thanks to the innovative curtain motor, which slowly opens her living room curtains as the sun rises, letting soft light fill the space and waking up her whole family in the most relaxing way. All she wants is a few sweet breaths of air on those quiet days when she can't open the windows without rousing every family member, pulling apart your child's curtains as slowly and quietly as possible, so her little ones won't wake up. And in the afternoon, working from home, Lauren closes the blinds through her app to block out blinding sun and glare during a video call. It responds in seconds, then sends her a notification when the task is complete. Lauren can also command Alexa with her voice while she\u2019s got both hands full from other tasks, and stays where she is, whether sitting or standing, to switch the curtains.  </p> <p>User Story #2: Michael Michael, a 25-year-old graduate student, is renting his first apartment.

Michael said the only thing he was surprised about was how easy it was to install his innovative curtain motor; with basic tools, it took him less than ten minutes to set up on his existing curtain rod. The app\u2019s video guide made everything easy to understand and follow. Michael later personalized the schedules so that his blackout curtains slide closed every night automatically, then open gradually on weekends to allow him to sleep in. When he goes on holiday, he flicks the \u201choliday mode\u201d switch to randomly turn up and down the curtains, giving his house a live-in feel.

We worked closely as a team all and everyone contributed their ideas and insights equally throughout the idea development process. We initially proposed an in-person workshop to provide a more energetic exchange of ideas. But considering our respective schedules and commitments, we settled on a Zoom meeting. </p> <p>We also started a collaborative Google Document for us to meet and synthesize our ideas. This shared whiteboard allowed each team member to brainstorm on their own proposal in real time, mapped directly to identified user needs. Google Docs format was especially useful here for quick categorization/movement of ideas. This tool made all contributions equal, so no voice would dominate the conversation. Crucially, the Google Doc was an archive of our thoughts; all the little pieces that we might forget or lose were saved in one place.</p> <p>Rapid ideation was also used in the session. It pushed us to express ourselves quickly, which helped create an environment where we could explore our own unique ways of thinking. The pace of ideating was important to keep up the momentum so that we could get as much in our basket as possible.</p> <p>The list of requirements we compiled was rooted in previous project assignments, during which we thoroughly defined user needs and product specifications. These foundations stemmed from direct input by stakeholders, detailed user case analysis, and extensive market research. This research involved reviewing competitor products and closely analyzing customer feedback to clearly delineate user expectations and preferences. The insights gained from these assignments served as the backbone of our brainstorming process, allowing us to stay concentrated on developing a product that genuinely addresses user needs, rather than veering off into features that lack substantial value.</p> <p>Once we had generated a diverse array of ideas and feature suggestions, we proceeded to categorize the requirements into specific groups, such as safety, functionality, and user-centric features. This categorization helped us visualize where our concepts were heavily focused and highlighted areas that required further exploration or refinement.</p> <p>In order to establish the priority level for each proposed feature, we engaged in a collaborative discussion to determine which features would be classified as high, medium, or low priority. Each team member's insights were valued during this decision-making process, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the potential impact of each feature. Ultimately, we distilled the results of our discussions, and the features deemed to have the highest priority were identified to be carried forward into the next phases of our project. This structured approach not only guided our development efforts but also aligned our team\u2019s focus on the most critical elements that would enhance the user experience.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#intro-overview","title":"Intro / Overview","text":"<p>The block diagram shows the system for our automatic curtain raiser designed by TechMinds.
