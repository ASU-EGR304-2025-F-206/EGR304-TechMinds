Lauren loves waking up naturally, all thanks to the innovative curtain motor, which slowly opens her living room curtains as the sun rises, letting soft light fill the space and waking up her whole family in the most relaxing way. All she wants is a few sweet breaths of air on those quiet days when she can't open the windows without rousing every family member, pulling apart your child's curtains as slowly and quietly as possible, so her little ones won't wake up. And in the afternoon, working from home, Lauren closes the blinds through her app to block out blinding sun and glare during a video call. It responds in seconds, then sends her a notification when the task is complete. Lauren can also command Alexa with her voice while she\u2019s got both hands full from other tasks, and stays where she is, whether sitting or standing, to switch the curtains.  </p> <p>User Story #2: Michael Michael, a 25-year-old graduate student, is renting his first apartment. He\u2019s a brilliant home enthusiast always looking for interesting ways to make his place smarter. Michael said the only thing he was surprised about was how easy it was to install his innovative curtain motor; with basic tools, it took him less than ten minutes to set up on his existing curtain rod. The app\u2019s video guide made everything easy to understand and follow. Michael later personalized the schedules so that his blackout curtains slide closed every night automatically, then open gradually on weekends to allow him to sleep in. When he goes on holiday, he flicks the \u201choliday mode\u201d switch to randomly turn up and down the curtains, giving his house a live-in feel.

We worked closely as a team all and everyone contributed their ideas and insights equally throughout the idea development process. We initially proposed an in-person workshop to provide a more energetic exchange of ideas. But considering our respective schedules and commitments, we settled on a Zoom meeting. </p> <p>We also started a collaborative Google Document for us to meet and synthesize our ideas. This shared whiteboard allowed each team member to brainstorm on their own proposal in real time, mapped directly to identified user needs. Google Docs format was especially useful here for quick categorization/movement of ideas. This tool made all contributions equal, so no voice would dominate the conversation. Crucially, the Google Doc was an archive of our thoughts; all the little pieces that we might forget or lose were saved in one place.</p> <p>Rapid ideation was also used in the session. It pushed us to express ourselves quickly, which helped create an environment where we could explore our own unique ways of thinking. The pace of ideating was important to keep up the momentum so that we could get as much in our basket as possible.</p> <p>The list of requirements we compiled was rooted in previous project assignments, during which we thoroughly defined user needs and product specifications. These foundations stemmed from direct input by stakeholders, detailed user case analysis, and extensive market research. This research involved reviewing competitor products and closely analyzing customer feedback to clearly delineate user expectations and preferences. The insights gained from these assignments served as the backbone of our brainstorming process, allowing us to stay concentrated on developing a product that genuinely addresses user needs, rather than veering off into features that lack substantial value.</p> <p>Once we had generated a diverse array of ideas and feature suggestions, we proceeded to categorize the requirements into specific groups, such as safety, functionality, and user-centric features. This categorization helped us visualize where our concepts were heavily focused and highlighted areas that required further exploration or refinement.</p> <p>In order to establish the priority level for each proposed feature, we engaged in a collaborative discussion to determine which features would be classified as high, medium, or low priority. Each team member's insights were valued during this decision-making process, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the potential impact of each feature. Ultimately, we distilled the results of our discussions, and the features deemed to have the highest priority were identified to be carried forward into the next phases of our project. This structured approach not only guided our development efforts but also aligned our team\u2019s focus on the most critical elements that would enhance the user experience.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#intro-overview","title":"Intro / Overview","text":"<p>The block diagram shows the system for our automatic curtain raiser designed by TechMinds.

This worked, but it was harder to see all the modes and transitions at once. The final design makes the curtain behavior more explicit on Mihir\u2019s board by organizing the logic into clearer states (for example, Idle, Opening, Closing, Paused, Error), consistent with the updated UML state diagram. This makes the flow of decisions easier to read and test, even though the hub role itself did not change.</p> </li> <li> <p>More consistent handling of ADC\u2011based messages - In the proposal, each board and feature tended to read ADC values in its own way, and some conversions were done locally instead of in a common pattern. This made it harder to keep scaling and thresholds consistent across temperature, light, and motion inputs. In the final version, the way ADC values are read and interpreted is more consistent with the design shown in the UML diagrams. Each analog message (from temperature, light, or motion circuits) is read into Mihir\u2019s board and processed in a similar pattern, which simplifies calibration and makes the message structure between boards clearer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cleaner use of inter\u2011board digital signals - The proposal allowed for digital connections between boards, but their exact meaning and usage were not clearly defined. This could lead to confusion about what each line represented and when it should be checked. The final software assigns clearer roles to the digital lines between boards, in line with the updated sequence and interaction diagrams. Each important digital connection now has a defined purpose (such as a specific status or control flag), and the code checks these signals in a more structured way, reducing ambiguity in inter\u2011board messaging.</p> </li> <li> <p>Added checks for sensor and subsystem problems - Originally, the code focused mainly on the normal situation where all boards and sensors were connected and working properly. It did not handle unusual values or missing inputs in a structured way. In the final design, Mihir\u2019s software includes more checks around the ADC readings and inter\u2011board messages. If a sensor signal is outside a reasonable range or a board appears inactive, the software can take safer actions (such as stopping the motor, ignoring that input, or relying on local control), improving real\u2011world robustness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Smoother interaction between automatic logic and buttons - In the earlier design, button inputs could interfere with ongoing automatic decisions, sometimes leading to awkward or sudden changes in curtain movement. The behavior of manual overrides compared to automatic mode was not fully worked out. The updated software, reflected in the UML diagrams, treats button presses more carefully so they work better with the existing states and messages. Button actions are interpreted in a way that makes transitions between automatic operation and manual control smoother and more predictable, while still keeping Mihir\u2019s board as the central decision point.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"07-Software-Design/","title":"Software Design","text":""},{"location":"07-Software-Design/#software-design-block-diagram-process-diagram-and-message-structure","title":"Software Design: Block Diagram, Process Diagram, and Message Structure","text":"<p>This page shows the system overview and control logic for our team\u2019s automated curtain control system.

Learned","text":"<p>The following are the top 10 key takeaways our team learned from working on this project.</p> <ul> <li>Working with real hardware showed how even small wiring mistakes, like a loose ground connection or crossed signal wires, can cause big problems like erratic sensor readings or motor stalls, so careful hardware checks, multimeter verification, and clear labeling of every wire became essential for reliable testing and debugging.</li> <li>Planning software with diagrams and states before writing code made it much easier to organize features like automatic curtain control and avoid \"spaghetti code\" as the project grew more complex with multiple sensors and inter-board communication.</li> <li>Version control with Git and frequent commits helped the team track every change, easily roll back mistakes during integration, and understand exactly who changed what when reviewing code history or troubleshooting bugs.</li> <li>Clear communication inside the team, especially about pin assignments, ADC scaling, and connector interfaces, prevented many frustrating integration bugs between Mihir's hub board and the sensor boards from Zane and Adrian.</li> <li>Testing early and often, starting with individual sensors, then connectors, then full system demos exposed issues with thresholds, motor timing, and signal noise well before the final deadline, reducing last-minute stress and rework.</li> <li>Writing simple, focused functions (like separate ones for ADC reading, motor control, and state transitions) instead of cramming everything into long main loops made debugging, testing individual pieces, and reusing code much easier throughout development.</li> <li>Data sheets and reference manuals for the PIC18F57Q43, sensors, and motor driver were critical resources, taking time to read them upfront about ADC configuration, PWM settings, and pin functions saved hours of trial-and-error experimentation later.</li> <li>Building in basic error handling and fallback modes, like ignoring bad sensor readings or switching to manual button control when a subsystem fails, improved the system's robustness and made live demos much smoother, even when hardware acted up unexpectedly.</li> <li>Using a consistent naming scheme for signals (like\u00a0temp_adc_raw,\u00a0light_threshold), files (mihir_main.c,\u00a0sensor_read.c), and functions (read_temperature(),\u00a0drive_motor_ccw()) helped keep the whole project understandable for all team members, even when reviewing each other's code.</li> <li>Time management and breaking the work into small milestones like \"connector design complete by week 4,\" \"basic motor control by week 6\", made it easier to balance hardware prototyping, coding, integration testing, and documentation throughout the busy semester.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"09-Reflection/#recommendation-for-future-students","title":"Recommendation for Future Students","text":"<ul> <li>Start learning the PIC microcontroller toolchain early: Get MPLAB X IDE, MCC code generator, and the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano board set up during the first week, and practice basic blink/ADC examples so you're not fighting installation and debugger issues when real project deadlines hit.</li> <li>Practice embedded C programming basics before class: Get comfortable with pointers for ADC buffers, structs for sensor data, interrupt handlers, and bit manipulation for pin control, these concepts are everywhere in microcontroller code and much harder to learn under project pressure.</li> <li>Use Git version control from day one: Commit frequently with clear messages like \"Added temperature ADC scaling\" and use branches for new features so you can safely experiment with motor timing or sensor thresholds without breaking the main working code.</li> <li>Read data sheets carefully and build test circuits early: Study the PIC datasheet for your pin functions and peripherals, then prototype each sensor (temperature, photoresistor, motion) on a breadboard with simple test code before committing to final PCBs, waiting until integration week leads to cascading hardware fixes.</li> <li>Communicate constantly with teammates about interfaces: Agree early and document pinouts, expected ADC voltage ranges (0-5V), signal meanings, and timing expectations in a shared spec sheet or README, then test inter-board connections weekly vague assumptions about \"that digital pin\" cause weeks of debugging pain.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Appendix/","title":"Appendix - Main Page","text":"<p>The Appendix
